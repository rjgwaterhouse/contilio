# Decisions

Used styled components for ease.

Used blue from Contilio website

Used shared components where necessary

Used if statement to set button disabled state - although more verbose I feel it is clearer and easier to edit.

Used Google Charts as used before and easy to implement.

# Improvements

Just realised i have used functional components as opposed to class based. I will happily refactor if you need me to!

I have placed the majority of types in one file - for larger projects I would keep shared types in one place and then include "local" ones in the same folder next to the component itself.
